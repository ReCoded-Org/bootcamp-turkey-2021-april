People have been coming to the wise[a] man[n] complaining about the same problems[n] every time. One day he told[v] them a joke[n] and everyone roared[v] in laughter[n]. After a couple of minutes. He told them the same joke and only a few of them smiled[v]. When he told the same joke for the third time no one laughed anymore.

The wise[a] man smiled and said[v].

You canâ€™t laugh[v] at the same joke over and over. So why are you always crying about the same problem.
