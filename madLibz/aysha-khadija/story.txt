Today I went[v] to the zoo[n], their I saw[v] a naughty monkey[n] jumping up and down in its tree he jumped[v] frequently through large tunnel that led to it is small[a] cage[n]. I got some peanuts and passed them through the cage[n] to a gigantic gray monkey[n] towering above my head[n]. Feeding that animal made me hungry[a], I went[v] to get a creamy[n] scoop of ice cream. I filled my stomach[n]. afterwards I had to run[v] quickly to catch our bus. when I got home I thanked[v] my mom for a remarkable[a] day at the zoo[n].
