Dear Santa Claus,

I have been a very happy[a] child[n] this year . I have helped my Mom[n] and Dad[n] with chores around the house[n] . I clean[v] the room[n] every day . 
I would really like to be on the gift[n] list this year ! I would love to have a red[a] bicycle[n] for Christmas . If you could put  money[n] inside of my stocking that is hanging on the wall[n] , that would be great[a] ! 
I am very happy[a] for your visit and will leave out cookie[n] and milk[n] for you and some branch[n] for your reindeer . Merry Christmas !
