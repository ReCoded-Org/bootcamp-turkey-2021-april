Once, when I was six years old, I saw[v] a marvellous[a]picture in a book on rainforests called Real-Life[n] Stories. It depicted a boa constrictor swallowing a wild animal. Here is a replica of the picture. I thought[v] a great[a] deal about goings-on in the jungle[n] and, in turn, with a crayon, managed to produce my first drawing. My drawing was not of a hat[n]. It showed[v] a boa constrictor digesting an elephant[n]. I then drew[v] the insides of the boa constrictor, so that the grown-ups could understand.
