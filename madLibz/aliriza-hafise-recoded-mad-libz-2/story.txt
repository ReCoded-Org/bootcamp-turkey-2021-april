Flamenco, form of song[n], dance, and instrumental mostly[a] guitar music commonly associated with the Andalusian Roma of southern[a] Spain. The roots[n] of flamenco, though somewhat mysterious, seem to lie in the Roma migration from Rajasthan to Spain between the 9th and 14th centuries. These migrants brought with them musical instruments, such as tambourines, bells, and wooden castanets[n], and an extensive[a] repertoire of songs and dances. In Spain[m] they encountered the rich cultures of the Sephardic Jews and the Moors. Their centuries-long cultural intermingling produced[v] the unique art form known as flamenco.
