Today, with school we went to the zoo. There, I saw many huge animals[n] jumping and fighting in their cage. They screamed loudly[a] and it was so scary[a]. I got some bananas[n] and fed the monkeys[n], through the cage. The lions[n] were so impressive. It was really scray[v]. At the end of the visit, I was sad[a] that all these animals[n] were imprisoned[v] in their cages. But this crazy[a] day at the zoo was still an amazing[a] experience.
