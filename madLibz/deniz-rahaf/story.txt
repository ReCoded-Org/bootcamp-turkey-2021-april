I walk through the color jungle. I take out my [a] canteen. There's a [a] parrot with a [a] [n] in his mouth right there in front of me in the [a] trees! I gaze at his [a] [n]. A sudden sound awakes me from my daydream! A panther’s [v] in front of my head! I [v] his [a] breath. I remember I have a packet of [n] that makes go into a deep slumber! I [v]it away from me in front of the [n].Yes he's eating it! I [v] away through the [a] jungle. I meet my parents at the tent. Phew! It’s been an exciting day in the jungle.
