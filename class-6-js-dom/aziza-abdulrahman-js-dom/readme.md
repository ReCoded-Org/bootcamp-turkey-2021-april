# Dom and Array Challenge

## Challenge 1
Our team created this website but header looks a bit off. Let's fix it! First, you need to console log the content of h2 tag. After that, select the header and place it in the center using Javascript.

## Challenge 2
Looks like we forgot to implement counter functionality.. :( so, let's do it. Counter should increase by 1 every time someone clicks on 'Increase counter' button. However, when someone writes a certain number in the input box, counter should increase by the provided number. (try googling how to get input value ;) ).
Bonus:
Create 'Decrease counter' and implement decrease counter functionality. It should follow the same logic as increase counter.

## Challenge 3
As the last challenge, let's display the list of the people who worked on this website. You should use the TEAM_MEMBERS array of names placed in script.js, when the Generate Names button is clicked render them as <li/> inside of them empty <ul/> tag that is located in the challengeThree div.
