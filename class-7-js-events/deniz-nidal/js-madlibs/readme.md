- Start with this index.html, which has several input elements and a button:

- Link index.html to index.js using `script` tag.

- Add an event listener to the button so that it calls a makeMadLib function when clicked.

- In the makeMadLib function, retrieve the current values of the form input elements, make a story from them, and output that in the story div (like "Pamela really likes pink cucumbers.")
