# Board Project Presentation

10 minutes per group.

Please have chat open. I will give you timing warnings in chat.

## Part 1: Reflection (3 minutes)

Each person speaks, so about 1.5 minutes per person.

1. What did you think of your first experience with backend?
2. What was different about a React project versus the other two?

## Part 2: Demo (6 minutes)

Demo your app. Please have a plan for the order in which you will demo, so that
you can demo everything you want within the 6 minutes. It makes me sad when I
have to cut people off, I know you are all excited to demo the app. If you
follow the deploy instructions below, people can poke around your app even more
later.

## Part 3: Code (2 minutes)

Demo one piece of code that you think would be interesting to show.

### Deploying

Deploy with Netlify. It's really, really easy, just sign up and select the
Github repo, follow the instructions, and it should just work.

subdirectory of this directory.
