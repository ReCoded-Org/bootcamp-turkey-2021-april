    <!-- This looks like a mess wish there was a wya to display this like a real code -->
   <p> The last code I wrote today was :
     <pre><code>
   public void requestAccess(){
  // Here, thisActivity is the current activity
 if
(ContextCompat.checkSelfPermission(MainActivity.this,
                Manifest.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE)
                != PackageManager.PERMISSION_GRANTED) {

            ActivityCompat.requestPermissions(MainActivity.this,
                    new String[]{Manifest.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE},
                    1);

            // Permission is not granted
        } else {
            showFilePicker();
            // Permission has already been granted
        }
    }
    </pre></code>
     </p>
