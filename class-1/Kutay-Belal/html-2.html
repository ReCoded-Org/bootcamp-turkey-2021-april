   <p>
    The last code I wrote today was : 
    <code><pre>
    public void requestAccess(){
        // Here, thisActivity is the current activity
        if (ContextCompat.checkSelfPermission(MainActivity.this,
                Manifest.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE)
                != PackageManager.PERMISSION_GRANTED) {

            ActivityCompat.requestPermissions(MainActivity.this,
                    new String[]{Manifest.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE},
                    1);

            // Permission is not granted
        } else {
            showFilePicker();
            // Permission has already been granted
        }
    }
     </pre></code>
