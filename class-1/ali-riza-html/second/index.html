    <!-- This looks like a mess, I wish there was a way to display this like a real code -->
  <p>The last code I wrote today was :</p> 
  <code>
    public void requestAccess(){
        // Here, thisActivity is the current activity
        if (ContextCompat.checkSelfPermission(MainActivity.this,
                Manifest.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE)
                != PackageManager.PERMISSION_GRANTED) {

            ActivityCompat.requestPermissions(MainActivity.this,
                    new String[]{Manifest.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE},
                    1);

            // Permission is not granted
        } else {
            showFilePicker();
            // Permission has already been granted
        }
    }
  </code>
