      <code>
        public void requestAccess(){ // Here,
        thisActivity is the current activity if
        (ContextCompat.checkSelfPermission(MainActivity.this,
        Manifest.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE) !=
        PackageManager.PERMISSION_GRANTED) {
        ActivityCompat.requestPermissions(MainActivity.this, new
        String[]{Manifest.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE}, 1); // Permission is
        not granted } else { showFilePicker(); // Permission has already been
        granted } }    
      </code>
