# If conditions, return statements exercise

## Challenge 1
Write a function that fulfills the following requirements:
* It takes a single parameter, a number.
* If the number is between 10 and 20, console.log the number.
* If the number is less than 100, return the number divided by two.
* If the the number is greater than 20, console.log the square of the number.
* If the number is greater or equal to 100 but less than 200, return just the number.
* Otherwise return the number multiplied by two.

## Challenge 2
Write a function that fulfills the following requirements:
* It takes two parameters, a number and a string.
* If the length of the string is less than the number, then console.log "String was too short." and return false.
* If the length of the string is equal to the number, then console.log "Exact match." and return the number.
* If the length of the string is greater than the number, do not console.log anything, and return -1.

Call this function for all three cases, assigning them to variables, and console.log the results of the function calls.

## Bonus: switch-case statement
Write a function that takes a single argument, a string. Use a **switch-casew** statement (you may need to look this up).

If the argument is `RED`, return 0
If the argument is `BLUE`, return 1
If the argument is anything else, return 2.
