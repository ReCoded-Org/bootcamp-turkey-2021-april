## Pesudo code

This shouldn't be written as BLA BLA BLA 
its importants stuff :=)

my pesudo code is about a grade evaluator for students
0    to  50  => Failed the class
51   to  60  => "D grade"
61   to  70  => "C grade"
71   to  80  => "B grade"
81   to  90  => "A grade"
91   to  100 => "S grade"

My Pesudo Code:

Create an integer and name it grade
Let user enter an integer and assign it to grade
check the status of the grade and return back
if {
    grade is less than 0 or higher than 100 => return false entry!
}
else {
    if {
        grade is (equal to or higher than 0) and (less than or equal to 50) => return "D grade" 
    }
    else if {
        grade is (higher than 50) and (less than or equal to 60) => return "C grade" 
    }
    else if {
        grade is (higher than 60) and (less than or equal to 70) => return "C grade" 
    }
    else if {
        grade is (higher than 70) and (less than or equal to 80) => return "B grade" 
    }
    else if {
        grade is (higher than 80) and (less than or equal to 90) => return "A grade" 
    }
    else {
        return "S grade"
    }
}
